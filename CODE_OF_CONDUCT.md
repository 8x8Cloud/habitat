# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
Diversity is one of the greatest strengths a community can have and many times
that strength is born from the friction that can only come through sharing of
differing perspectives.

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming and enouraging environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards
Habitat is a diverse community of professionals and volunteers who come from all
over the world to make Habitat better. Community members may fulfill many roles
including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other members of the community.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Practice empathy. Don't
insult or put down others. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes
can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another
community member uncomfortable _or_ if they tell you so, stop immediately, make amends,
and move forward.

As you are working with other members of the community, please keep in mind the following guidelines, which apply equally to founders, mentors, those who submit new features and pull requests, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

The following list isn’t exhaustive; but these few examples can help all of us communicate well so that the community can work better together:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Exercising patience and friendliness
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

The previous list applies to all forms of communication: Slack (or any web chat), discourse, the issue tracker, and any other forum that is used by the community.

Please keep in mind that:
* Your work will be used by other people, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others.
* Decisions that you make will often affect others in the community.
* Disagreements happen, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. When disagreements do happen, let’s work together to solve them effectively and in a way that ensures that everyone understands what the disagreement was.
* People may not understand jokes, sarcasm, and oblique references in the same way that you do. So remember that and be kind to the other members of the community.
* Sexist, racist, and other prejudicial or exclusionary comments are not welcome in the community.

### Unacceptable Behavior
Harassment comes in many forms, including but not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and sexual images.

As a community that meets in physical public spaces, harassment also includes: stalking, persistent following, intrusive or otherwise unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Examples of other unacceptable behaviors by participants include but are not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances.
* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks particulary those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion or disability.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission ("doxing")
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

If you have any lack of clarity about behaviors we include in the definition of "harassment", please read the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/). In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with
decision-making authority, will *not* be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take action they deem appropriate, up to and including temporary ban or permanent
expulsion from the community _without warning_ (and without refund in the case of
a paid event).

Any physical violence _or_ intimidation, threatened or acted on, is a serious
offense and will result in immediate exclusion from the community and appropriate
follow up with law enforcement (no, we're not kidding).

### Handling Incidents
When an advocate or maintainer notices someone behaving in a way that is outside of our guidelines (a violator) the advocate should make every reasonable attempt to help curtail that behavior.  The advocate may:

* Remind the violator about our Community Code of Conduct and provide a link to this document.
* Ask the violator to stop the unacceptable behavior.
* Raise the issue with a maintainer, the community manager, or any member of the core project team.
* Allow time for the violator to correct the behavior.

The advocate should take the following steps if the behavior is not brought inline with our guidelines or the incident is not resolved.

* Consult with another maintainer to make a judgement call about what reasonable corrective actions are warranted.
* Apply the corrective action.
* Document the incident.

#### Documenting Incidents

All incident reports will be kept in a private repository that is shared with the advocates, maintainers and Community Manager..

The important information to report consists of:

* Identifying information (name, email address, Slack nick, etc.) of the person doing the harassing
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

If you feel your safety is in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Community Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the community as a whole to grow, learn, and become better.


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
Our community will convene in both physical and virtual spaces and this Code
of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual
is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at humans@habitat.sh. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
